these are some of the python scripts used while i am doing my office work

Zhang03 is to insert huge amount of images inside each row of a column of the table inside a word file.
Zhang is my colleague, I helped him to make this script. 

Combineword03 is not a regular online word merging tool, it took me sometime to realize the function in merging word just like merging pdf.
What it solves: Regular online word merging tool for free, will introduce misalignment into the merged word file caused by spacing. This python script solves the problem. Why not convert to pdf first and merge the pdf? This is because the resulting document should be in word file for further edit.
